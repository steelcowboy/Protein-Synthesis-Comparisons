# Protein Synthesis Comparisons v0.2
Programs to convert DNA to RNA and find protein sequences. 

I implemented in C++ and Python to compare speeds. Not intended
for use currently but it will eventually be cleaned up.

## To Use
For general purposes simply run `make`. To test the programs
against each other run `make comparison`.

*Note:* Make comparison will create the protein_synthesis 
binary without any cout statements

I also made a fancier version with better functions and output
support; the test option is broken in version 0.2 but will be 
fixed in 0.3
