# Protein Synthesis Comparisons v0.3
Programs to convert DNA to RNA and find protein sequences,
implemented in C++ and Python to compare speeds. 

The C++ version is completely usable with many different
flags. The Python version will eventually be updated to 
match the functionality of the C++ version.

## To Use
For general purposes simply run `make`. To test the programs
against each other run `make comparison`.

*Note:* Make comparison will create the protein_synthesis 
binary without any cout statements

I also made a fancier version with better functions and output
support.

## To Do
- Move everything to a separate library
- Clean up some implementation
- Bring Python version up-to-date
- Make documentation
